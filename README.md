# project Miles | Team 8 Project 1 (Super Rough First Draft)

Introducing project Miles, a game especially for teens featuring your favorite Marvel Avengers, designed to help you live a healthier life in a fun way that works for you and your friends.  This README file is designed to introduce you to key features of version 1 and our plans for future versions.

## Getting Started

You can view a demo of project Miles here: 
* [project Miles demo](https://gabesucich.github.io/Project1_CGJK/)

Download the project Miles app for your phone here:
* [Google Play for Androids](https://play.google.com/apps) 
* [iStore for iPhones](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/)

On your first visit, you'll choose a Marvel Avenger as your Avatar and alter-ego.  You only have to do this once; we'll remember you next time.  Once you have your Avenger Avatar, choose how you'd like to earn some points.  In version 1, you can either "Grab A Meal" or "Go Somewhere."  You'll choose how you'll get there (walking, biking, even skateboarding counts for points!), then let us know your starting and end points.  When you complete point-worthy tasks, you'll boost your score and earn badges.  

### project Miles Evolving

In future versions, we plan to add a leaderboard of friends nad local users, more challenges and activities through which you can earn points, and ways to share your activities on your favorite social media.
